I am an Engineer who likes to build things.
I am also the founder of INORA Labs, a place where we try to make application that adapt to the user and not the other way around.
As a researcher and author I love reading and learning new things, which fits in perfectly with my builder personality.
If you have something you would like to work with me on let me know, and I will defintly contribute in any way I can.

This is where I keep all my projects and learnings so have fun exploring :)
